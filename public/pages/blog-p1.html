            <h5>What’s Your Desired Taste Profile?</h5>
            <p>
              Do you like your coffee black or with milk? Whatever kind of
              coffee you prefer, always get good quality coffee; it has
              freshness, aroma and taste that’s hard to beat. Once brewed, it is
              smooth and pleasant on the palate, with low acidity and minimal
              bitterness. The flavors you’ll experience result from the coffee
              you choose.
            </p>
            <p>
              High-grade brewed Arabica beans have floral, fruity and citrus
              flavors with bright acidity and wine notes. In contrast, Robusta
              has a heavy body, distinct bitterness and earthy flavor. It also
              displays low acidity, and a sometimes nutty, sometimes dark
              chocolate aftertaste.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tip2" class="flex-item box-align-end">
            <h5>Growing Regions</h5>
            <p>
              Coffee grows in over 70 equatorial countries in the Coffee Belt.
              It thrives in rich soils at higher elevations with cooler
              temperatures. Each growing region produces a unique coffee bean
              flavor profile.
            </p>
            <p>
              Floral, fruit and wine notes are prominent in African coffees from
              Ethiopia, Rwanda and Kenya. They are bright and flavorful with a
              distinct sharp acidity. In contrast, Central Americans from
              countries like Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua are clean and
              well-balanced. They also show fruity tones and moderate-to-high
              acidity. South American coffees (Brazil, Peru and Colombia)
              contain pronounced chocolate and nut flavors. They generally have
              medium body and acidity with hints of plum and brown sugar.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Southeast Asia, coffee tends to be earthy, nutty and spicy.
              These coffees have a rich, heavy body, bitter aftertaste and silky
              molasses undertones.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tip3" class="flex-item box-align-start">
            <h5>Growing Altitude</h5>
            <p>
              You’ll often see the elevation at which coffee was grown printed
              on the package. This will be a number followed by “masl,” which
              means “meters above sea level.” This is important, because
              elevation has a big impact on a coffee’s flavor profile.
            </p>
            <ul class="article-1-list">
              <li>
                <b>Low-altitude coffee</b> (1250 masl) tends to be earthy with a
                heavier body and refined acidity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Medium-altitude coffee</b> (1250 – 1500 masl) has a little
                more acidity and sweetness with a more luscious mouthfeel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>High-altitude coffee</b> (grown at 1500 – 2200 masl) is more
                aromatic and complex in flavor. It also has pronounced acidity
                with sweet fruit flesh or wine grapes undertones.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="tip4" class="flex-item box-align-end">
            <h5>Processing Method</h5>
            <p>
              While this may seem inconsequential, your coffee’s processing
              method after harvest really affects its taste.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Natural</b> processed coffees tend to be sweeter and fruitier,
              with a more complex flavor. These dry-processed coffees also have
              a larger body, lower acidity and undertones of chocolate, cherries
              and dried fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast, <b>washed</b> coffees have a cleaner, brighter and
              fruitier flavor profile. These coffees shine due to their unique
              high-grown flavor and refined acidity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Semi-washed</b> or wet-hulled coffee beans are rich and earthy,
              with a unique sweetness and acidity that other coffees can’t
              match. This is typical of Indonesian coffee from Sumatra, and
              offers coffee lovers a one-of-a-kind taste experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the <b>honey</b> processing method (pulped natural
              coffee) gives beans a sweeter taste than washed coffee. The coffee
              has a cleaner flavor, complex acidity and more juiciness than
              natural processed coffees.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tip5" class="flex-item box-align-start">
            <h5>Caffeine Content</h5>
            <p>
              There’s nothing worse than the coffee jitters! When choosing
              coffee, the amount of caffeine you desire (and can handle) is
              critical. Too much might have adverse effects on your general
              health. As a result, many coffee enthusiasts seek coffees with
              lower levels of natural caffeine. Robusta coffees, on average,
              contain twice as much caffeine as Arabica coffee beans.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div id="tip6" class="flex-item box-align-end">
            <h5>What’s Your Preferred Brewing Method?</h5>
            <p>
              You’ve probably heard the saying, “different strokes for different
              folks.” The same goes for coffee! Some coffees tend to be better
              for specific brewing methods than others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bean origin also counts. Although there are two main coffee
              varieties – Arabica and Robusta – it’s not that simple. You might
              feel like the best coffees are 100% Arabica or an Arabica-Robusta
              blend. Different types of coffee have distinct qualities, which
              impacts which preparation method suits them best.
            </p>
            <p>
              Darker roasts from Brazil, Kona, Indonesia, Vietnam and Ethiopia
              often make the best <u>espresso</u>. They are resplendent with
              rich chocolate and spicy and nutty caramel notes. The extended
              roasting period gives the beans a deep, dark color and brings out
              more oils to the surface. This yields a shot with a sweet, nutty,
              balanced taste and rich, thick crema. Light, medium or medium-dark
              roasts from Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Colombia are ideal for
              <u> pour-over coffee </u>. Manual brewing brings out the fruity
              and floral or nutty and chocolate flavor profiles. It also
              highlights the bright acidity typical of these coffees. Besides,
              the extraction here is much slower than for espresso. Ethiopian,
              Costa Rican and Guatemalan coffees are your best bet if you prefer
              light roasts. This roast profile highlights the rich, zesty and
              floral tones in these coffees, best experienced as
              <u>drip coffee</u>.

            <h5>Sustainable Coffee Farming and Fair Trade Initiatives</h5>
            <p>
              It’s no longer enough that coffee tastes good. Third wave coffee
              culture consumers now demand that producers explain the “story”
              behind their coffee. Did the farmer use
              <b> sustainable coffee farming methods </b> and an eco-friendly
              drying process? What about pesticides? These questions matter a
              great deal to consumers. And so they should!
            </p>
            <p>
              According to estimates, Brazilian coffee farmers (the world’s top
              coffee producers) use 76 million pounds of pesticides every year.
              Since 2019, they have licensed a further 475 pesticides, a third
              of which are considered toxic and banned in the US and EU. That’s
              not to say all Brazilian producers are farming this way. In fact,
              many are doing quite the opposite. However, it’s food for thought.
              Nowadays, consumers seek out this information and make purchasing
              decisions based on their values.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another critical question for coffee lovers is whether the
              production methods harmed any animals. To think of Kopi Luwak and
              all its horrible effects on the well-being of palm civet cats
              makes my blood boil! As delicious as this coffee is, many,
              including me, won’t buy it due to this fact. I’d recommend
              training yourself to look out for these types of coffee concerns
              whenever you choose coffee.
