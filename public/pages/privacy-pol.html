          about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
          websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
          about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
          automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
        </p>
        <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
